            <hr>
            <p>I grew up on the westside of Indianapolis and went to Ben Davis High School. From there I graduated as the Valedictorian of the class of 2017, and went of to Rose-Hulman to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</p>
            <br>
            <p>However halfway through my first year due to my moms cancer diagnosis I could no longer afford to attent the school and had to rechart what my future would look like now that I couldn't afford the school I wanted to go to.</p>

            <h1 class='header'>Navy</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>After leaving Rose-Hulman, I was working whatever jobs I could find trying to get by. After about a year I decided to join the Navy and pursue a Special Forces Contract.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After a year of training and gaining over 50lbs in muscle (I was skin an bones before the I started training), I secured an EOD Special Forces contract. However, during training I had a leg injury that prevented me from doing my job and was medically dischared.</p>

        <div id='section3'>
            <h1 class='header'>Sales</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>After another devestating blow and I had to rechart my future again. I still couldn't afford school, and I wasn't sure what I would be able to do without a degree.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So I decided to learn how to be a professional salesman. Eventually I secured a position as a Financial Advisor and gave people financial security by selling financial services.</p>

        <div id='section4'>
            <h1 class='header'>Here & Now</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>However, I didn't feel fulfilled with a career in sales, and found out about Eleven Fifty. Luckily with the stimulus I was able to attend for free.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, I'm back to my roots. Learning to code again and hoping to secure a job that I originally wanted.</p>
